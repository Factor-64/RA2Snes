## Feature Additions

* Add ability to refresh achievements and leaderboards
* Leaderboard support
* Add support for unsupported games as soon as reading the memory of those games is supported by SD2Snes

## Future Console Support

If new consoles allow for reading memory addresses I will look into supporting them in RA2Snes (probably will rebrand).
